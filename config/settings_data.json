The top layer is softer than the bottom - something that you should be able to tell by just pressing down on each airfiber&reg; layer with your hand.

This recommendation comes directly from customers and was part of the reason we created the airweave Mattress Advanced. You may find that the cooling benefits diminish slightly but you'll feel more comfortable. During your 100 night trial we recommend testing out new sleep positions and eliminate any bad habits. Sleeping on your back (known to be the healthiest sleep position) and side are the most popular sleep positions for our customers.<\/p>"

One of those, which we may not even realize, is that you may be using too much energy when turning while asleep (yes we are still using energy while we sleep!). If you have a mattress that you're sinking into, then you're using more energy which could wake you up at night. Or maybe you're partner is moving and you're waking up from their motion transfer. Our mattress has been designed to provide you ease of movement and very low level of motion transfer through our highly resilient and extra supportive material that has you feeling like you're floating on top rather than sinking.<\/p>\n<p>Waking up at night due to feeling too hot, hotspots on your mattress or even too cold? Airweave has a highly breathable design that allows natural airflow and helps regulate your core body temperature. We've tested airweave against memory foam and have shown that airweave can significantly lower your core body temperature which means you feel comfortable all night.

Airweave gets rid of the usual problem of uncomfortable hotspots that most mattresses generate. Control the temperature of your overall sleep environment with the blankets you choose. During the winter, add a warmer blanket to hold in warmer, dispersed air. For warmer months, use a lightweight blanket and you'll enjoy a cooler airflow.<\/p>"
